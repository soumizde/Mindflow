# Let's Talk Design 

The app was designed to be to the point. The interface is intuitive and easy to use. We had always felt that setting up a reminder for a task is not really helpful because that just reminds us of a really long task when it is too late and we cannot do much about it. So we decisded that we needed to add longer tasks and divide them into small ones so that we can keep up with them. This app will additionally allow you to make decisions about what needs to be taken care of immediately and what can be done later.

### Stretch Goals & Future Additions

We want to eventually add a progress tracker and a scrore streak to allow some amount of gamification in the task manager. It should make things more interesting and make people more consistent in the long run. We are open to suggestions and would love to collaborate if anyone has any implementation ideas :)
