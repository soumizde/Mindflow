# Let's Talk Design 

The app was designed to be to the point. The interface is intuitive and easy to use. We had always felt that setting up a reminder for a task is not really helpful because that just reminds us of a really long task when it is too late and we cannot do much about it. So we decisded that we needed to add longer tasks and divide them into small ones so that we can keep up with them. This app will additionally allow you to make decisions about what needs to be taken care of immediately and what can be done later.

### Stretch Goals & Future Additions

We have spent a lot of time and effort in trying to design and develop an application that really fulfils the needs of someone on the lookout for a Task Manager and prioritizer. That said, we know that there is always room for improvement and we have a few things in mind that we do want in the near or distant future.
